## The big picture
Programming is a means of getting a computer to complete a pre-specified task. In order for a computer to complete a task, it must be told EXACTLY what to do by the computer programmer. Computer programmers (like yourself) use programming languages (like C, Python, or Javascript) to solve interesting computational problems(problems that involve math). 

More specifically, a programmer comes up with algorithms and data structures that can effectively store problem relevant information and operate on that information in some interesting fashion. An algorithm is a step by step process that does a certain task, as long as some set of preconditions are satisfied. For example, one could view cleaning their clothes in an algorithmic sense. First, we store our clothes in a bin. If the bin is full, then we transfer the clothes from the bin into the washing machine. After that, we place soap into the machine, close the lid, and start the washing machine. When the washing machine is done, we transfer the clothes from the washer to the dryer, throw in some dryer sheets, close the dryer, and start the dryer. Lastly, the clothes from the dryer are transfered to your room for future use. This may be the longest winded explanation of laundry you have ever received, but I did it in this way to show you how much goes into explaining even a simple concept such as doing the laundry. The goal of a programmer is to come up with interesting solutions to problems / do interesting things, and to do these things in a manner that is time efficient, memory efficient, energy efficient, elegant, beautiful, meaningful, etc. 

A data structure is a way of storing information. The information we store may be numbers, letters, words, or groupings of these pieces of information. For example, a store might have a data structure that they refer to as a "customer object" which may contain a name, age, gender, list of prior purchases, etc. There are often multiple ways to store information about something, and a programmer must make an informed decision about how information is stored / the data structures that they use, because those decisions will impact the performance of the algorithms they use to do interesting stuff with the information stored in the data structures. Lets go back to the laundry example. After the clothes are brought back to your room, you have a choice for how you want to store your clothes. If you are in a rush, you might just throw your clothes into your drawers at random. While this may mean that you only have to spend a small amount of time storing your clothes, it may leave your clothes wrinkled as well as make it difficult to select an outfit. On the other hand, if you take a little bit more time and fold the clothes and then organize them into drawers, then your clothes will appear nicer and it is easier to select an outfit from the drawers. A super fancy individual might hang up particular clothing items that are prone to wrinkling, which again comes at a time cost but helps further increase appearance of your clothes. Good programmers must make informed tradeoff decisions with data structures based on what they are trying to accomplish with the program as well as what they value.



## Intro to Programming
The purpose of this session is to provide a brief introduction to programming assuminh no prior experience. Programming, and more generally computer science, is an extremely deep field and only so much can be covered in a single session. With that being said, this repo should give a solid overview and provide starter code that can easily be extended by a motivated student.
