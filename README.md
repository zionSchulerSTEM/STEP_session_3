# STEP session 3
## The big picture
Programming is a means of getting a computer to complete a pre-specified task. In order for a computer to complete a task, it must be told EXACTLY what to do by the computer programmer. Computer programmers (like yourself) use programming languages (like C, Python, or Javascript) to solve interesting computational problems(problems that involve math). 

More specifically, a programmer comes up with algorithms and data structures that can effectively store problem relevant information and operate on that information in some interesting fashion. An algorithm is a step by step process that does a certain task, as long as some set of preconditions are satisfied. For example, one could view cleaning their clothes in an algorithmic sense. First, we store our clothes in a bin. If the bin is full, then we transfer the clothes from the bin into the washing machine. After that, we place soap into the machine, close the lid, and start the washing machine. When the washing machine is done, we transfer the clothes from the washer to the dryer, throw in some dryer sheets, close the dryer, and start the dryer. Lastly, the clothes from the dryer is transfered 

## Intro to Programming
The purpose of this session is to provide a brief introduction to programming assuminh no prior experience. Programming, and more generally computer science, is an extremely deep field and only so much can be covered in a single session. With that being said, this repo should give a solid overview and provide starter code that can easily be extended by a motivated student.
