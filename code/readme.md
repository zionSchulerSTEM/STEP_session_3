# Running the code in this directory
In order to run the code in this directory, you are going to need to run some commands from the command line interface. I will attach the commands needed to run the programs below.

## Running python programs from bash

Generally speaking, running a python program is straightforward. The python command tells bash to use python, and the second word tells python which program to run. You should replace the programName with the name of your program/file
```bash
python programName.py
```
### Command to run hello-world.py
```bash
python hello-world.py
```
### Command to run programming-intro.py
```bash
python programming-intro.py
```

### Command to run programName.c
```bash
gcc programName.c -o programName
./programName
```

### Command to run hello-world.c
```bash
gcc hello-world.c -o hello-world
./hello-world
```

### Command to run programming-intro.c
```bash
gcc programming-intro.c -o programming-intro
./programming-intro
```
