## Running python programs from bash

Generally speaking, running a python program is straightforward. The python command tells bash to use python, and the second word tells python which program to run. You should replace the programName with the name of your program/file
```bash
python programName.py
```
### Command to run hello-world.py
```bash
python hello-world.py
```
### Command to run programming-intro.py
```bash
python programming-intro.py
```
